## What is Exlang
Exlang helps teams build, evaluate, and release language models end-to-end.

Exlang is inspired by Ruby on Rails: opinionated defaults, a cohesive full-stack path, and a shared project shape so model development feels predictable instead of improvised.

In Exlang, the model is the product: a versioned, runnable release with everything needed to use it (not just an inference layer).

## Batteries included
Exlang is built for the whole loop:

- data → training → evaluation → packaging → runtime → experience → release

## Manifesto
- **Model over app**: ship intelligence, not just an interface.
- **Conventions over glue**: strong defaults beat bespoke pipelines.
- **Exploration over docking**: prioritize the horizon over comfort.
- **Pirate over navy**: stay independent, neutral, and platform-agnostic.
- **Speed over spaghetti**: ship small experiments, not spaghetti.

## Core mission
Make it dramatically easier to build, evaluate, and release language models as shippable products.

- Reduce the friction from idea → model.
- Make training and evaluation repeatable build steps.
- Make shipping a model feel as normal as shipping software.

## Tech stack (Elixir)
The stack is centered on Elixir/Erlang (OTP) for concurrency, distribution, and reliability.

## Who it’s for
- Builders shipping local-first and open models end-to-end.
- Engineers who want fewer choices up front and more forward motion.
- Researchers who want to run experiments faster.
