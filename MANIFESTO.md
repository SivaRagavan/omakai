# Manifesto

> Draft — this manifesto will evolve.

## Model over app
Ship intelligence as the core product, not just an interface.
Release models as runnable, versioned artifacts that stand on their own.

## Conventions over configuration
Default paths remove guesswork and wiring.
A shared project shape keeps teams aligned and pipelines predictable.

## Progress over stability
Favor forward progress, iteration, and discovery.
Keep building new capabilities while keeping stability in view.

## Speed over ceremony
Ship experiments fast with tight feedback loops.
Keep processes lightweight so iteration stays cheap and clean.

## Pirate over navy
Stay independent, neutral, and platform-agnostic.
Build for portability and optionality across ecosystems.

## Supervision over autonomy
Work happens in supervised units with explicit oversight.
Failures must be detected, contained, and recoverable.

## Fault tolerance over perfection
Assume every step can fail and handle it explicitly.
Prefer retries, fallbacks, and partial progress over all-or-nothing outcomes.

## Concurrency over serialization
Decompose work into independent tasks that run in parallel.
Join results without blocking on unrelated work.

## Right-sized intelligence over maximum scale
Use the smallest model that reliably solves the task.
Escalate only when necessary to protect latency and cost.
